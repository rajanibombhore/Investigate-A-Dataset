Udacity Project: Data Analysis for No-Show Appointments

The project is about the data analysis on medical appointments having a no-show. 
Later a prediction is made to see if an appointment has a possibility of a no-show depending on the analysis obtained from the data investigation.

The dataset contains 110k+ data of the patients and the appointment details. The details found in the dataset are,
The details of the person who has scheduled the appointment (Patient ID, Age and Gender).
The details of the appointment (AppointmentID, Scheduled date, appointment date and Neighbourhood(Location of the appointment)).
